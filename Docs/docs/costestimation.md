# Cost Estimation

![header image](media/index/Genie_Header.png)

We provide ProvisionGenie free of charge, but that doesn't mean, that you don't need to pay licensing fees to Microsoft.

## Azure

You will need an Azure subscription to run the Azure Logic Apps:

While testing, we ended with less than 0.01$ per run and in the meanwhile, Azure Logic Apps became part of the [free Azure tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/five-more-free-services-available-with-an-azure-free-account/). This means that you won't need to pay for ot AT ALL. More information can be found here, where you can also [sign up for a free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free). You can also use the [Azure Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)

## Power Apps

To use this solution, every person using this solution will need:

- a Microsoft 365 license (for example Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium)
- a Power Apps per app plan OR Power Apps per user plan

Effectively October 1, 2021, both plans are now priced at 50% of the previous rate. More information can be found in [Microsoft's announcement](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/news/pricing_and_licensing_updates_coming_to_power_apps)

If you already have a Power Apps per user plan for all users who shall use this app, you are already set.
If you already have a Power Apps per app plan (purchased before October 2021), you will need to look if you already exceeded the limit of two apps. If yes, we advise to consider upgrading to a Power Apps per user plan as of October 2021, as this unlocks not only this app but unlimited apps.

We make use of Dataverse, which is the only reason why a Power Apps license is required. Please read our [Architecture Decisions](architecturedecisions.md) to understand why working around the licensing fee for Power Apps by using for example SharePont or Dataverse for Teams is not a good idea.
