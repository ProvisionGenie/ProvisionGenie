ProvisionGenie is an app for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) that lets you learn how your team can work best in Microsoft Teams. As Teams is a platform that can connect to a lot of services, we want to make your start even easier. We will

- skill you up and
- guide you through some questions regarding how your Team should look like and
- let you request the 'Team of your dreams' as a result of that process, which will be provisioned automatically for you.
