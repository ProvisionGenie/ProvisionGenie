# Accessibility Guide

We put in some thoughts on Accessibility and inclusion - as we want ProvisionGenie to serve as many people as possible.

## Accessibility in UI

Making ProvisionGenie accessible is near and dear to our hearts, which is why we made some effort to

* support a highcontrast theme that blends into the UI of Microsoft Teams
* follow even more inclusive design good practices such as

    * using the  `AccessibleLabels` property for all controls
    * using `Role` property for headings
    * grouping content into containers
    * using the `Notify` function to interact with users
    * following a logical control order.

Accessibility is one of our core design principles, which is why we never choose be

## Language and images

* All texts, including error messages and hint texts are localized in all 11 available languages.
* We also aim to use inclusive language, which is why we don't use male generic language.
* We use lots of pictures to illustrate and contextualize the learning content we provide. We made sure to choose illustrations that depict people with various skin colors.

We feel that the lack of mental and linguistic representation in media and applications excludes too many people.
