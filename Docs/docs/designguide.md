# Design Guide

You could run ProvisionGenie as a standalone app in browser or on mobile, but we highly recommend using it as intended as a personal app in Microsoft Teams. Requesting a team being in its context makes sense as it reduces task-switching but maintains people's focus. Staying in the flow your work is crucial for productivity and ProvisionGenie aims to support this.

## Design principles

To increase the look and feel of Teams, we strongly followed the Teams app design principles

- Native: the app uses native Teams design components and blends into Microsoft Teams UI
- Well described: text, icons, and images make it clear what the is for and how to use it
- Easy to use: based on a scenario people need to do in Teams
- Globally inclusive: people of all backgrounds, skillsets and disciplines can use the app. It's culturally and socially aware
- Accessible: the app meets Teams accessibility requirements in terms of color contrast, navigation alternatives, and more

## Themes

We provide all three themes that are present in Microsoft Teams as well:

- default
- dark mode
- high contrast mode

The app will automatically be displayed in the theme of that is currently selected in Teams, but users can override this setting in the UI.
