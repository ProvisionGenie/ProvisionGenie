# Roadmap

![header image](../media/index/Genie_Header.png)

In addition to our issues list we want you to know what's new and what's coming. To have a look into the future, this is the place to be. To know what we did in the past, head over to our [Release notes](releasenotes.md).

## Next up

We are right now working on the features: 

- **add members to a Team**
- **add more than 1 owner to a Team** - as it is a best practice
- **make all screens optional** so you can skip steps

We also improve the deployment process to be an automated, idempotent script so that you can re-run it easily in case needed.
