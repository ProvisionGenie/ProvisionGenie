# Accessibility Guide

We put in some thoughts on Accessibility and inclusion - as we want ProvisionGenie to serve as many people as possible.

## Accessibility in UI

Making ProvisionGenie accessible is near and dear to our hearts, which is why we made some effort to

* support a highcontrast theme that blends into the UI of Microsoft Teams
* follow even more inclusive design good practices such as

    * using the  `AccessibleLabels` property for all controls
    * using `Role` property for headings
    * grouping content into containers
    * using the `Notify` function to interact with users
    * following a logical control order.

Accessibility is one of our core design principles, which is why we never choose something to just be pretty on the cost of not being accessible anymore.

## Language and images

We feel that the lack of mental and linguistic representation in media and applications excludes too many people, why we chose to not have a white, male, english speaking person in mind as a default user of our app.

* All texts, including error messages and hint texts are localized in all 11 available languages.
* We also aim to use inclusive language, which is why we don't use male generic language.
* We use lots of pictures to illustrate and contextualize the learning content we provide. We made sure to choose illustrations that depict people with various skin colors.
