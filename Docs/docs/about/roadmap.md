In addition to our issues list we want you to know what's new and what's coming. To have a look into the future, this is the place to be. To know what we did in the past, head over to our [Release notes](releasenotes.md).

## Next up

We will start working on the following features soon:

- let users create more than one list and more than one library
- check if a Team with the requested name already exists
- add approval
