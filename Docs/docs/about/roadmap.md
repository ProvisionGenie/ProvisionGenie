In addition to our issues list we want you to know what's new and what's coming. To have a look into the future, this is the place to be. To know what we did in the past, head over to our [Release notes](releasenotes.md).

## Next up

We will start working on the following features soon: 

- consolidating Azure Logic Apps
- let users link list and library to a channels to display them there as a tab
- let users create more than one list and more than one library
~~- provide bicep files for deployment instead of ARM templates~~

To manage expectations: We will take some xmas break to recharge batteries ‚≠ê
