# ProvisionGenie

![Genie Header image](media/index/Genie_Header.png)

ProvisionGenie is an app for [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) that lets you learn how your team can work best in Microsoft Teams. As Teams is a platform that can connect to a lot of services, we want to make your start even easier. We will

- skill you up and
- guide you through some questions regarding how your Team should look like and
- let you request the 'Team of your dreams' as a result of that process, which will be provisioned automatically for you.

- [5 Dataverse tables](corecomponents/logicapps.md#solution-overview) where we log all Teams requests
- [5 Azure Logic Apps flows](corecomponents/logicapps.md) which we use to provision the requested Teams

We also listed [some features that we would like to add in the future](https://github.com/ProvisionGenie/ProvisionGenie/issues)- but consciously decided to not build for our first release, as we wanted to ship rather sooner than later - to get your valuable feedback.
